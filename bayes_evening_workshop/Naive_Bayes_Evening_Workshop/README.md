# Naive Bayes Evening Workshop

Welcome!  
This repo is meant to serve as accompanying material to the Introduction to Python for Data Science: Coding the Naive Bayes Algorithm evening workshop.  

## Following along
If you'd like to follow along by reading this code here on GitHub, that's wonderful, and no more is needed; you're in the right place.  :)  

If you'd also like to follow along on your own computer with Python installed, you'll want to clone or download this repo.
Clone or download this repo into, say, a directory called ```evening_workshop```.  Then in your terminal you'll want to run:

```
cd evening_workshop/
python run.py
```

To make it easier to run and follow along, there are intentionally no dependencies other than Python itself.

Further, this code has been tested on both Python 2 and 3, so you should be fine with either.  That said, it is intended for use with Python 3, since that's the future.  ;)

Lastly, keep in mind that this code is written in a way that is more geared towards interpretability than performance.
